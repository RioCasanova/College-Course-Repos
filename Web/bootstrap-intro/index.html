            almost any
            animal it comes across, which it why it has numerous 'Animals Sitting on Capybaras' blogs dedicated to it.

        <p class="mb-5">They spend most of their lives chilling in the grasslands and nearby bodies of water. Since they
            live in
            groups of 10-20, it's kinda like the wild animal version of an office water cooler. And maybe they're not
            fluffy or cuddly — more coarse and wiry — but they do look like they'd be really good listeners.</p>
