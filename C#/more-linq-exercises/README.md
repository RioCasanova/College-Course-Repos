## Query 4

Print out all product items on a requested order (use Order #33). Group by Category and order by Product Description.
You do not need to format money as this would be done at the presentation level. Use the QtyPicked in your calculations.
Hint: You will need to using type casting (decimal). Use of the ternary operator will help.
