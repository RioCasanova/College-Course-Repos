# DMIT 2018 Take Homework

The following markdown files are used to practice LINQ. 
The first three examples use the "Syntax" & "Method" queries.  
All examples beyond the first three files will only use the "Method" query.  
<br>These are split up into two areas.
<br>
* Basic LINQ Queries.
  * You should have no problems solving them using the information provided during the lectures.
  
* Intermediate LINQ Queries.  
  * These queries will build on the skills you have used in the "Basic LINQ Queries" and demonstrate the LINQ language’s power.

* Group By Methods
  * These queries requires the usage of the GroupBy method. 
   
* Advance LINQ Queries.  
  * These queries will provide a challenge for you to solve. However, you should have no problems completing them.

<br>

##### Format
The format of the code examples will follow the following:
* Code Setup </br>
  - All examples will either use a collection that has been defined
with the example or will reference the Westwind database.  The Westwind.bacpac can be found in this directory.

* Statement of what is trying to be review
* Collapse area with the solution.  Please note that they maybe more than one way in which to get the answer
* Image of the expected output.
