    <h1>Markup Demo</h1>
    <h2>Paragraph Example</h2>
    <p>There are many ways to make a presence on the web and a website is just one of them. Other types of 
        web presence include social media channels and sites that allow customers to review your business. 
        Before you start making a website, make sure you understand what’s provided by the different types of 
        web presence and the costs and benefits associated with each type<p>
    <h3>Link Example</h3>
    <h4>Try Photoshop</h4>
    <p>Photoshop is part of Creative Cloud and comes with Adobe CreativeSync, so your assets are always at 
        your fingertips right when you need them. CreativeSync powers your Creative Cloud Libraries and 
        Adobe Stock, and it connects your mobile and desktop apps</p>

            <h2>Image Example</h2>
            <h3>Photoshop Logo</h3>

            <img src="img/photoshop.jpg" alt="Photoshop Logo">

            <h3>Heading Example 1</h3>
            <h4>Quality Guidlines</h4>
            <p>These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behaviour, but 
                Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assume 
                that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. 
                Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much 
                better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking 
                for loopholes they can exploit</p>

                <h5>Unordered List Example</h5>
                <h6>Champions League Quarter Finals</h6>
                <p>A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into the 
                    Bayern box. It’s a decent delivery, but there’s nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and 
                    Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands 
                    one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the greatest of 
                    ease from six yards!</p>
                
                <ul>     
                    <li>Barcelona</li> 
                    <li>Manchester United</li> 
                    <li>Real Madrid</li> 
                    <li>Paris St Germain</li>
                    <li>Wolfsberg</li> 
                </ul>    
                <h2>Ordered List Example</h2>
                <h3>Open Bridge From Photoshop</h3>
                <p>To open Bridge from within Photoshop, go up to the File menu (in Photoshop) in the Menu Bar along 
                    the top of the screen and choose Browse in Bridge. If you're the type who likes keyboard shortcuts, you 
                    can choose the same command by pressing Ctrl+Alt+O (Win) or Command+Option+O (Mac).</p>
